# Simple OpenGL Engine

A lightweight and straightforward OpenGL-based rendering engine designed for educational purposes, quick prototyping, or minimalistic 3D applications. This engine provides the basics of rendering, shader management, texture loading, and camera controls, allowing you to focus on building graphics applications without extensive boilerplate code.

## Features

- **Basic Rendering**: Render simple 3D objects like cubes, spheres, and planes.
- **Shader Support**: Easy management of vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Camera Control**: Basic camera movement, including rotation and zoom.
- **Lighting**: Simple lighting models to illuminate 3D scenes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Requires a C++11 compatible compiler.
- **OpenGL**: Version 3.3 or higher.
- **GLFW**: For window and input management.
- **GLM**: For vector math.(included)
- **GLAD**: For OpenGL function loading.(included)
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
