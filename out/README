# SGL V0.1.2
====================================

This directory contains the compiled build of the XandO engine, along with its associated assets and scenes.

## Directory Structure
------------------------

* `engine/`: This folder contains the engine's assets, including graphics, audio, and other resources.
* `scenes/`: This folder contains the scenes used to demonstrate the engine's features.
* `XandO`: This is the executable file for the test scene, which can be run to demonstrate its features.

## Running the Engine
