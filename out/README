# Build Directory README

This directory contains the compiled build of the XandO engine, along with its associated assets and scenes.

## Directory Structure

* `engine/`: This folder contains the engine's assets, including graphics, audio, and other resources.
* `scenes/`: This folder contains the scenes used to demonstrate the engine's features.
* `XandO`: This is the executable file for the SGL engine, which can be run to demonstrate its features.

## Running the Engine

To run the engine, simply execute the `XandO` file. This will launch the engine and load the default scene.

## Scenes

The `scenes/` folder contains several scenes that demonstrate different features of the engine. These scenes can be loaded by selecting them from the engine's menu.

## Assets

The `engine/` folder contains all the assets used by the engine, including graphics, audio, and other resources. These assets are used to create the scenes and demonstrate the engine's features.

## Notes

* Make sure to run the engine in a compatible environment to ensure proper functionality.
* The engine's features and scenes are subject to change as the project evolves.
